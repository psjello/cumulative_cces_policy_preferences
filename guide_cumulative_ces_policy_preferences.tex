\bigskip

Each year, the Cooperative Election Study (CES)\footnote{Formerly the
  Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES).} asks respondents
about their preferences on issues like abortion, immigration, the
environment and more. However, variable names for question items often
change from year to year.

\medskip

The \textbf{Cumulative CES Policy Preferences} data set compiles various
policy preference question items from CES respondents over time. This
represents an effort to track, rename, recode, and append together
557,456 responses across 54 policy preference question items from 16
individual CES survey data sets, ranging from 2006 to 2021.

\medskip

The resulting time series is available as a
\href{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OSXDQO}{downloadable
data set from the Harvard Dataverse}. This data set can be combined with
the geographic, demographic, and political characteristics of each
respondent from the
\href{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/II2DB6}{Cumulative
CES Common Content} by merging on the \texttt{case\_id} and
\texttt{year} variables.

\medskip

Question items are categorized into nine issue area categories. Variable
names include the issue category, and a suffix related to the specific
question. Variable labels contain a condensed, one sentence description
of the policy that respondents are being asked if they support or
oppose. For each question item, this guide provides details on the years
where the item appears, frequency tables for response values, and it's
original, year-specific variable name and question wording.

R users are advised to download and use the .dta version of the data
set, as the .tab version replaces informative value labels with numbers.
To use .dta files in R, install and load the package ``haven'' via the
following lines of code:
\texttt{install.packages("haven");\ library(haven)}.

\medskip

Some question wording varies slightly across time, with more extreme
changes warranting a note at the end of each question item's section.
Further, some item response values are shortened and/or slightly
re-worded from their original values out of convenience. When shortening
and re-wording occurs, the original value wording is listed inside the
item's respective question wording table.

\medskip

Users of the Cumulative CES Policy Preferences dataset are encouraged to
reference this guide to examine details on any interested question item
before use. Users of previous versions of the guide should familiarize
themselves with any relevant updates described in the section ``Version
updates''.

\hypertarget{version-updates}{%
\section{Version updates}\label{version-updates}}

Updates and changes from the previous (V1) to current version of the
data:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Policy items from the 2020 Common Content were added, when applicable.
\item
  Four policy items on immigration were added: \texttt{immig\_deport},
  \texttt{immig\_report}, \texttt{immig\_reduce} and
  \texttt{immig\_wall}.
\item
  Three policy items on trade policy were added.
\item
  Three policy items on health care were added, and the item previously
  named \texttt{repealaca} was renamed to \texttt{healthcare\_aca}.
\item
  One correction was made with respect to \texttt{immig\_services} in
  2014. Previously, responses from \texttt{immig\_border} were recorded
  as responses for \texttt{immig\_services} in 2014. This error is
  corrected in the current version.
\item
  One correction was made with respect to \texttt{healthcare\_aca},
  previously \texttt{repealaca}, in 2014. Previously, responses from
  \texttt{repealaca} in 2014 were re-coded and switched---i.e.~responses
  of support coded as oppose, and vice versa---to match question wording
  in other years that asked about support for repealing the ACA.
  However, question wording in 2014 already asked about repealing the
  ACA. Thus, this update does not recode any responses for this question
  item, now named \texttt{healthcare\_aca}.
\item
  Previously, responses from \texttt{gaymarriage} were re-coded and
  switched from 2006 through 2011 to match question wording from 2012
  onwards that asked about support for \emph{legalizing} gay marriage,
  rather than the 2016 through 2011 question wording asking about
  support for \emph{banning} gay marriage. Instead, this update
  separates responses from 2006 through 2011 into
  \texttt{gaymarriage\_ban}, and responses from 2012 onwards into
  \texttt{gaymarriage\_legalize}.
\item
  Previously, responses from \texttt{enviro\_mpg} were re-coded and
  switched in 2018 to match question wording from all previous years
  that asked about support for \emph{raising} fuel efficiency standards,
  rather than the 2018 and 2020 wording asking about support for
  \emph{lowering} gay marriage. Instead, this update separates responses
  from 2018 and 2020 into \texttt{enviro\_mpg\_lower}, and responses
  from earlier years into \texttt{enviro\_mpg\_raise}.
\end{itemize}
